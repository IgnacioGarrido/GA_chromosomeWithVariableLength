# GA_oneItemPerRow
This repository contains the files needed to perform a genetic algorithm in which it has to be chosen an item per row. The algorithm receives a table in which each column represents an entity to be chosen (eg. an enterprise), and each row represents an item to be selected, with its corresponding weight.
