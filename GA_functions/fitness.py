#FITNESS_CALCULATION
# Description: This function calculates the fitness of an individual.
#
#   @Inputs:
#       chrom: chromosome.
#       mast_np: numpy array with the weights of each item.
#       min_item_per_row: If 1, it is calculated the minimum selection of items 
#       (one item per row) for a given individual. If it is 0 the maximum is 
#       calculated.
#       MAX_LENGTH_CHROM: Maximum length of the chromosome up to which there is 
#           no penalization.
#       PENALIZATION_LENGTH: (fitness) Penalization value per each new 
#           transportist over the limit MAX_NUM_TRANS.
#       PERCENT: (fitness) Percentage of the total cost that penalizes each  
#           extra new trasnportists.
#       PENALIZATION_RATING: (fitness) Penalization value per each bad 
#           transportist in the rating.
#       RATING_TRANS: List with the ordered rating of each transportist.

# Description: This function calculates the fitness of the Individuals, it 
#   normalizes it, and then it order the population from best to worst fitness.
#   Note that it order the input value pop, and it doesnÂ´t return anything.
#
#   @Inputs:
#       pop: population (list with Individuals).
#       mast_np: numpy array with the weights of each item.
#       min_item_per_row: If 1, it is calculated the minimum selection of items 
#       (one item per row) for a given individual. If it is 0 the maximum is 
#       calculated.
#       minimize: If 1 the fitness value is inverse normalized, i.e, higher
#           values mappped to 0 and lower to 1. Otherwise it is normaly
#           normalized.
#       MAX_LENGTH_CHROM: Maximum lenght of the chromosome up to which there is 
#           no penalization.
#       PENALIZATION_LENGTH: (fitness) Penalization value per each new 
#           transportist over the limit MAX_NUM_TRANS.
